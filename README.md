# Census Taker Game: Non-Response Follow-Up

## About This Project

This repository contains a simple HTML-based Census Taker game developed as a fun prototype to demonstrate the concept of "vibe coding" - quickly creating a functional prototype that captures the essence of an idea without getting bogged down in technical details.

## Purpose

This prototype was created to showcase how language models like Claude could potentially enhance interactive storytelling and character-driven games. The core concept explores the daily challenges of a census taker trying to collect information from residents who didn't respond to the initial census.

## Disclaimer

**This is not an official U.S. Census Bureau product.** This game was created for entertainment and educational purposes only. All characters, scenarios, and gameplay elements are fictional. Any thoughts, opinions, or interpretations expressed in this game are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent the views, policies, or positions of the U.S. Census Bureau or any other government agency or employer.

## A Note on Development

This project is intentionally simple and was developed quickly as a proof of concept. Real production development would:

- Involve proper software engineering practices
- Include comprehensive testing
- Feature accessibility considerations
- Implement proper state management
- Possibly integrate with actual language model APIs

A fully realized version of this concept could take many forms:
- A text-based interactive fiction experience
- A mobile app with more sophisticated graphics
- A 3D web-based game using Three.js or similar libraries
- A full VR experience in platforms like WebXR or Unity

## Aesthetic Choices

The deliberately retro aesthetic (8-bit style graphics, terminal-green text, and simple pixel characters) was chosen for two reasons:

1. **Development Practicality**: Simplified graphics allowed for rapid prototyping
2. **Nostalgia Factor**: The 1980s text adventure and early NES game styling creates an intentional juxtaposition between modern AI capabilities and vintage gaming aesthetics

## Getting Started

Simply download the HTML file and open it in any modern web browser to play. No installation or special software required!

## Contributing

Feel free to fork this repository and expand on the concept. Some interesting directions might include:
- Adding more diverse residents with unique personalities
- Implementing actual LLM integration for dynamic conversations
- Creating more detailed graphics while maintaining the retro feel
- Adding gameplay mechanics like time management or scoring systems
